## HTML Tage & Elements for Dummies

To put things very, *very*, __*VERY*__ simply...


### Tags

Tags are usually referred to as the *Building Blocks of HTML*, and that's exactly what they are. Everything in HTML is made of tags. Everything.


#### What does an *HTML Tag* look like?

Here are a few of the most common/basic tags:

##### Line Breaks (New Line)
```html
<br />
<br/>
<br>
```



### How are Elements different from Tags?

Elements [`<Open>`](https://) and `</Close>`

`<>`

<br /><br />

#### Single-Line
```html
<a href="URL">TEXT</a>
```

<a href="URL">
  TEXT
</a>
```
